  distance_matrices,
  choices,
  labels = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{distance_matrices}{A list of document distance matrices generated by the
`scaling_comparison()` function and returned in the `$distance_matrices`
field.}

\item{choices}{A dataframe indicating whether a preprocessing step was
applied or not, for each preprocessing step. This is generated by the
`factorial_preprocessing()` function and returned in the `$choices` field.}

\item{labels}{Optional argument giving names for each preprocessing step.
This is generated by the `factorial_preprocessing()` function and returned in
the `$labels` field.}

\item{baseline_index}{The index of the baseline distance matrix against which
we are comparing. Defaults to 128, which is the most minimal preprocessing
for our current implementation.}

\item{text_size}{The `cex` for text in dot plot generated by function.}

\item{num_comparisons}{The number of ranks to use
in calculating average difference. Defaults to 50.}

\item{parallel}{Logical indicating whether factorial prerpocessing should be
performed in parallel. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{cores}{Defaults to 1, can be set to any number less than or equal to
the number of cores on one's computer.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether more information should be printed
to the screen to let the user know about progress. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A result list object.
