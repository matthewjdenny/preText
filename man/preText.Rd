\title{preText: Diagnostics to Assess The Effects of Text Preprocessing Decisions}
\usage{
preText(
  preprocessed_documents,
  dataset_name = "Documents",
  distance_method = "cosine",
  num_comparisons = 50,
  parallel = FALSE,
  cores = 1,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{preprocessed_documents}{A list object generated by the
`factorial_preprocessing()` function.}

\item{dataset_name}{A string indicating the name to be associated with the
results. Defaults to "Documents".}

\item{distance_method}{The method that should be used for calculating
document distances. Defaults to "cosine".}

\item{num_comparisons}{If method = "distribution", the number of ranks to use
in calculating average difference. Defaults to 50.}

\item{parallel}{Logical indicating whether factorial preprocessing should be
performed in parallel. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{cores}{Defaults to 1, can be set to any number less than or equal to
the number of cores on one's computer}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether more information should be printed
to the screen to let the user know about progress. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A result list object.
}
\description{
Calculates preText scores for each preprocessing specification.

\section{preText functions}{

To use this package, You will first want to check out the
factorial_preprocessing() function which will take raw data and transform it
into document-frequency matrices using a factorial design and 6-7 different
preprocessing decisions. The next step in most applications will be to run
the preText() function, which will generate preText scores for each preprocessing
specification. These can then be fed to the preText_score_plot() and
regression_coefficient_plot() functions to generate interpretable output.
For more information on additional functions check out the GitHub README for
this package (https://github.com/matthewjdenny/preText) or the "getting
started" vignette by typing `vignette("getting_started_with_preText")` into
the console.
